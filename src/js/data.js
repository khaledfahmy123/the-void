    h: "#Do we live in a simulation?",
    txt: `A few months ago, while I was playing with my friend’s new oculus quest. I donned the VR headset and played a ping-pong game. The game was so realistic that it momentarily fooled my brain. When it ended, I instinctively tried to put the paddle down on the “table” and lean against it. Of course, the table didn’t exist, and I almost fell over. It was so easy to trick my senses into thinking that the virtual world was real that I began to think about what would happen to humanity if we kept developing this technology.

    #For the last few years, It turns out that some giants of Silicon Valley have set their sights on building these ultrarealistic simulations, which they call the metaverse. As we get closer to building out the full technosocial imaginary of the metaverse, we will be proving that it’s more likely that we already live in a simulated universe.

    #But the question is always “Do we have or will ever get the capabilities to build such technology?” Instead of stepping aside and just watching the human race striving to achieve a distant goal that may or may not even be real, I’m sure we may find answers elsewhere. I mean if we looked into human history, we may find conclusive evidence to end this debate. Come on around 10,000 years of human civilization and we haven’t yet figured out whether the sky is real or some RTX GPU running in the background. And we call ourselves intelligent life?#Let’s take it easy on the human race. Since the simulation hypothesis does not arrive at a falsifiable prediction, we can’t really test or disprove it, or CAN WE?

    #All the studies of the simulation hypothesis have missed a key element of scientific inquiry: plain old empirical assessment and data collection. To understand if we live in a simulation we need to start by looking at the fact that we already have computers running all kinds of simulations for low-level intelligence. The question here what is the thing that defines a simulation in other words what do all simulators share in common?

    #All computing hardware leaves an artifact of its existence within the world of the simulation it is running. This artifact is the processor speed. If for a moment we imagine that we are a software program running on a computing machine, the only and inevitable artifact of the hardware supporting us, within our world, would be the processor speed. All other laws we would experience would be the laws of the simulation or the software we are a part of. If we were a Sim or a Grand Theft Auto character these would be the laws of the game. But anything we do would also be constrained by the processor speed no matter the laws of the game. No matter how complete the simulation is, the processor speed would intervene in the operations of the simulation.#If we live in a simulation, then our universe should also have such an artifact. We can now begin to articulate some properties of this artifact that would help us in our search for such an artifact in our universe.

    #The artifact presents itself in the simulated world as an upper limit.*The artifact cannot be explained by underlying mechanistic laws of the simulated universe. It has to be accepted as an assumption or “given” within the operating laws of the simulated universe.*The effect of the artifact is absolute. No exceptions.

    #Now that we have some defining features of the artifact, of course, it becomes clear what the artifact manifests itself as within our universe. The artifact is manifested as the speed of light.

    #Space is to our universe what numbers are to the simulated reality in any computer. Matter moving through space can simply be seen as operations happening on the variable space. If the matter is moving at say 1,000 km per second, then 1,000 km worth of space is being processed by a function every second. If there were some hardware running the simulation called “space” of which matter, energy, you, me, and everything is a part, then one telltale sign of the artifact of the hardware within the simulated reality “space” would be a maximum limit on the container size for space on which one operation can be performed. Such a limit would appear in our universe as a maximum speed.

    #While some of us might be players from the “outside” world, trapped in the metaverse playing characters in this virtual reality, like in the Matrix, most of us, statistically speaking, would be simulated AI characters in a simulated virtual world, thinking that we are actually in the “real world.” If that sounds a little strange, perhaps the only appropriate reaction is the one that Keanu Reeves’ character Neo gave in the original Matrix film 23 years ago: Whoa.

    #As this article seems somehow rational, it's not 100% true i used some misleading misconceptions about the speed of light in purpose. Stay tuned for my next article to highlight the misconceptions revealing the true nature of light, Thanks for passing by #the_void   :)`,
